Chapter 1 Product Introduction
1.1 Product overview
The soil integrated sensor is suitable for measuring soil
temperature, moisture, total soil salt (conductivity), soil pH and
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. The soil comprehensive
sensor creatively measures the seven parameters of conductivity,
moisture, temperature, ph, and nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium, which greatly facilitates the customer's systematic
assessment of soil conditions. .
Compared with the German original high-precision sensor
and the actual soil drying weighing method calibration, the
sensor has high accuracy, fast response and stable output: it is
less affected by the salt content of the soil and is suitable for
various soil qualities. Can be buried in the soil for a long time,
resistant to long-term electrolysis, corrosion resistance, vacuum
potting, and completely waterproof.
1.2 Scope of application
It is widely used in scientific experiments, water-saving
irrigation, greenhouses, flowers and vegetables, grassland pastures,
rapid soil testing, plant cultivation, sewage treatment, grain storage,
and the measurement of various particulate water content and
temperature.

Note: The details of all measurable parameters of this
series of products, please refer to the actual product purchased.
When measuring frozen icy soil layers, the moisture value
will be low and inaccurate, requiring user compensation.
The factory default product is suitable for measuring
ordinary yellow soil, black soil and red soil. It is not suitable for
absolute moisture measurement on saline-alkali soils, sandy
soils, or other powdery objects with high salinity. It can still
characterize the relative moisture difference. For this type of
moisture measurement, you should contact the manufacturer for
separate calibration.
1.4 Calculation method and meaning of soil
moisture
The soil moisture calculated by this sensor is soil
一站式物联网供应平 set
4
volumetric moisture content (also called soil volumetric
moisture content), which is what people call "soil moisture" and
"soil moisture" in a popular sense.
The calculation method of soil volumetric water content is
the ratio of the volume of water in the soil to the total volume of
the soil. 0% means completely dry soil without any moisture,
and 100% means completely water without any soil.
1.5 System framework diagram
This sensor can be connected and used alone. First, use
12V DC power supply. The device can be directly connected to
a PLC with a 485 interface, and it can be connected to a single-
chip microcomputer through a 485 interface chip. The single-
chip microcomputer and PLC can be programmed through the
specified modbus protocol to cooperate with the sensor. At the
same time, use USB to 485 to connect to the computer, and use
the sensor configuration tool provided by our company for
configuration and testing.
5
This product can also be used in combination of multiple
sensors on a 485 bus. In theory, one bus can connect more than
16 485 sensors. If you need to connect more 485 sensors, you
can use 485 repeaters to expand more 485 devices. One end is
connected to the PLC with 485 interface, and the single-chip
microcomputer is connected through the 485 interface chip, or it
can be connected to the computer by using USB to 485. Use the
sensor configuration tool provided by our company for
configuration and testing.

2.2Interface description
The power interface is a wide-voltage power supply that
can output 12-24V. When wiring the 485 signal line, pay
attention to the A/B two lines can not be reversed, and the
address of multiple set devices on the bus can not conflict. The
line sequence description is shown in the following figure

Note: Please be careful not to connect the wrong wiring
sequence, the wrong wiring will cause the equipment to burn.
The factory default provides 1.25 meters of wire,
customers can extend the wire as needed or wire in order.
Note that there is no yellow line in the line sequence that
may be provided in some factory batches. At this time, the gray
line is equivalent to replace the yellow line.

2.4Quick test method
Select a suitable measurement location, avoid rocks, ensure
that the steel needle does not touch hard objects, throw away the
surface soil according to the required measurement depth, maintain
the original tightness of the soil below, hold the sensor vertically
and insert it into the soil. Do not shake left and right. It is
recommended to measure multiple times for average value within a
small range of a measuring point.
2.5Buried measurement method
Dig a pit with a diameter> 20cm vertically, insert the sensor
needle horizontally into the pit wall at a predetermined depth, and
fill the pit tightly. After a period of stability, measurement and
recording can be carried out for several days, months or even
longer.

2.6Notes
1. All steel needles must be inserted into the soil during
measurement.
2. Avoid strong sunlight directly shining on the sensor to
cause excessive temperature. Pay attention to lightning protection
in the field.
3. Do not bend the steel needle violently, pull the lead wire of
the sensor forcefully, and do not hit or hit the sensor violently.
4. The sensor protection grade is IP68, and the sensor can be
soaked in water.
5. Due to the presence of radio frequency electromagnetic
radiation in the air, it is not suitable to stay in the air for a long
time with electricity.
Chapter 3 Configuration Software
Installation and Use
Our company provides supporting "sensor monitoring
software", which can easily use the computer to read the
parameter of the sensor and modify the device ID and address
of the sensor flexibly.
3.1Connect the sensor to the computer
After connecting the sensor to the computer through USB
to 485 and providing power supply, you can see the correct
COM port in the computer (check the COM port in "My
Computer-Properties-Device Manager-Port").
11
As shown in the figure above, your serial port number is
COM10 at this time, please remember this serial port, you need
to fill in this serial port number in the sensor monitoring
software.
If the COM port is not found in the device manager, it
means that you have not inserted the USB to 485 or the driver
has not been installed correctly, please contact a technician for
help.
3.2 Use of sensor monitoring software
The configuration interface is as shown in the figure. First,
obtain the serial port number and select the correct serial port
according to the method in chapter 3.1, and then click to
automatically obtain the current baud rate and address to
automatically detect all devices and baud rates on the current
485 bus . Please note that you need to ensure that there is only
one sensor on the 485 bus when using the software to
automatically obtain it.
一站式物联网供应平 set
12
Then click to connect the device to get the sensor data
information in real time.
If your device is a gas concentration sensor, please select
"gas concentration sensor" in the sensor type, "formaldehyde
transmitter" for formaldehyde sensor, "analog transmitter
module" for analog transmitter, and "atmospheric pressure" for
atmospheric pressure sensor Sensor", illuminance sensor selects
"Illuminance 20W", oxygen sensor selects "Oxygen transmitter",
and other sensors select the default "No other sensor".
3.3Modify the baud rate and device ID
When the device is disconnected, click the device baud rate
and set address in the communication settings to complete the
related settings. Please note that after setting, please restart the
device, and then "automatically obtain the current baud rate and
address" to find the address And the baud rate has been changed
13
to the address and baud rate you need.
